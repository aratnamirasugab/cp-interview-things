A tree is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. 
From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has N nodes and N-1 edges.

A Binary Tree is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which 
each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

Traverse a Tree - Introduction:
https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/992/
-Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree
abbv : DLR

- In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree
Typically, for binary search tree, we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal.
abbv : LDR

- Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally visit the root
abbv : LRD

====
deletion occurs in post-order, because we delete left, right and then its root value.
also post order used widely in mathematical expression


====
BFS - Breadth First Search / Level Order Traversal
